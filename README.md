Was gonna keep this private but someone requested it 🤷‍♂️ sooo
don't complain about it being stupid or anything.
However issues are welcome.

## convenience
Since this script is made public, I made things a bit more convenient by storing literally everything in a variable. If you need to override any of the stock value, simply add the variable(s) that you want to override in battery.conf file so that you won't have to modify the script.
